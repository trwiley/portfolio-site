Sonification is a technique that can be used to explore data through the mapping of data parameters to sound parameters. It can be used to explore data in an experimental way that may reveal aspects of the data that are not obvious when looking at a visualization. Here, I used Max/MSP to create a sonification of Asian pottery data.
